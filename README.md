When I was young I enjoyed Chill Dubstep mixes by the YouTube channel TehChillstep. Unfortunately at some point all their videos were removed. I've tried many times over the years to find these mixes but yesterday I made a huge breakthrough and was able to save nearly 100% of the track lists for every single video on the channel.

If you want to listen to them I've compiled the tracks into playlists on this YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSiACKTMrcNAMyHIBZcQBlQ

Not every track was able to be added as some were on SoundCloud and others were just unfindable. Check the other file in this repo for the complete list of all the videos and their original descriptions as they were on the TehChillstep channel.

Enjoy!
